[00:26.02] Empty streets fill my mind
[00:29.01] Autumn has come to numb me blind
[00:45.01] 
[00:37.15] The end it reaches out for me
[00:42.14] My soul still calling to be free
[00:58.14] 
[00:51.28] I want the energy to breathe, to clear thier poisoned minds
[01:16.15] The energy i am, to end thier pointless lives
